Laser Defence System combines Arduino Nano, a light sensor, and a loud buzzer to protect your home at night. Imagine this: It's late, you're asleep, and an intruder tries to break in. Laser Defence System is ready.

How it works:
- Invisible lasers guard entry points.
- In the dark, it activates.
- Intruder disrupts lasers, setting off the buzzer.
- Loud alarm startles intruders and alerts you.

Use it at home or in small businesses. It's customizable, energy-efficient, and a powerful security upgrade.

As it's hard to carry more stuff into deeper parts of caves. The monitoring device should be small and wearable which can be developed using Nicla Sense ME as it comes with integrated BME688 which can measure all the required parameters like temperature, gases like CO2 equivalents and VOC's. As the Nicla Sense ME also supports TinyML anomaly detection can be done to give the user warning about the gases present. The data can be displayed on SSD1306 OLED module.
